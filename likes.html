	<h1>My Likes & Interests</h1>
</header>

<p>Something that is a big part of my life right now is making YouTube videos. I've had a passion for film since middle school but going in to high school, I never had an outlet to keep making videos. My big thing right now is trying to find a balance betwen school + work + youtube.</p>
<p>Here is the link to one of my favorite videos to-date. I got my co-worker a running sponsorship for the Boston Marathon:</p>

<p>I'm a big shoe person. I love shoes, and I never seem to have enough. In my dorm room alone I have 16 pairs (running + casual), which for me doesn't seem like a lot. In my opinion, the shoes make the outfit. My current favorite pair of shoes are the Yeezy 500s that I just picked up a week ago.</p>

<p>My favorite type of music is Rap / Hip Hop. Some of my favorite artists are Drake, Logic, Post Malone, and Eminem</p>
<p> I'm <strong>addicted</strong> to caffeine! I can't get through the day without it.</p>
